t-factory-server is a software aimed to manage Tomcat instances in a simple, standardized  and easy way via a Web Graphic User Interface that interact with agents (t-Factory-Agent) installed on remote servers.

tFactory usually fit well in scenarios when you hate to ask questions like:
* Which ports are available in a remote server?
* Which ports does the current instances have configured on remote server?
* Can you create a new instance in less than 1 minutes with custom settigns?
* Can you give me a report of all the instances in our environment with his respective ports configuration now?
* Can you create a image template and be distributed on remote servers in less than 2 minute?
* What are we going to do if operations guy don't want to use Chef, Puppet or other cool tools for tomcat management?
